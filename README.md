Code is still what you would call "beta".

To use, you'll first want a browser extension that can inject it into a webpage. I use [Script Runner](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/script-runner/?utm_content=addons-manager-reviews-link&utm_medium=firefox-browser&utm_source=firefox-browser) for firefox, you can also try [User JavaScript and CSS](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld?hl=en-US&utm_source=ext_sidebar) for chrome.

Once you have your extension of choice, navigate to [idavis-elvenar.com](https://idavis-elvenar.com). from here, open the extension and copy the js file content in this repository intto the "script" section.

That should be it, the script should run every time you load the page, so long as you keep the extension on the browser. the FA section of the webpage is under More -> Fellowship Adventures. you can [Skip straight there](https://idavis-elvenar.com/fellowship-adventures.html) if you'd prefer.

I totally understand if you're hesitant to just download some random sketchy file from some guy you know over the internet and try to run it on your computer. No pressure, was just a fun little project to play around with.

Good luck, and have fun.
