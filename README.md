# FA_waypoint_optimiser

Code is still what you would call "beta".

To use, you'll first want a browser extension that can inject it into a webpage. I use [Script Runner](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/script-runner/?utm_content=addons-manager-reviews-link&utm_medium=firefox-browser&utm_source=firefox-browser) for firefox, you can also try [User JavaScript and CSS](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/user-javascript-and-css/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld?hl=en-US&utm_source=ext_sidebar) for chrome.

Once you have your extension of choice, navigate to <a href="https://idavis-elvenar.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">idavis-elvenar.com</a>. from here, open the extension and copy the js file content in this repository into the "script" section. You don't even need to download the file, just open it from here, copy the contents and paste it in.

That should be it, the script should run every time you load the page, so long as you keep the extension on the browser. the FA section of the webpage is under More -> Fellowship Adventures. you can [Skip straight there](https://idavis-elvenar.com/fellowship-adventures.html#waypoints) if you'd prefer.

I totally understand if you're hesitant to just add some random sketchy code from some guy you know over the internet and try to run it on your computer. No pressure, was just a fun little project to play around with.

Good luck, and have fun.

# EA_Building Ranker

For those that have trouble keeping track of culture distribution throughout their cities, the Building ranker, when injected into <a href="www.elvenarchitect.com" target="_blank">ElvenArchitect</a>, gives you the option to highlight and rank all culture/population buildings based on a number/tile score and returns an average culture/population per tile across them all. Easiest way about this is to first find your username on <a href="elvenstats.com">ElvenStats</a>, update your info then click the "view city in elven architect" link.

Hope this helps.
